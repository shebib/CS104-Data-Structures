NOTE: The Qt interface was unfortunately... rm'd right before submitting. 
The @mention portion should still be fine though, as well as Part 1

datetime.cpp: holds and outputs time info
tweet.cpp: fields for a tweet, inc user, hashtags, etc.
twiteng.cpp: twitter engine, holds users, tweets, can search by hashtags, etc.
user.cpp: user object. Holds name, followers, following, etc.
twitter.cpp: main interface. Run this to start the program


## Compiling

To clean run make clean (deletes all .feed files as well)

NOTE: twitter.dat must be in the correct format
